# BMI Calculator (using Python)

The BMI calculator is a program developed using the Python programming language that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. 

BMI is a commonly used metric to determine if a person's weight is healthy for their height. The program takes in the user's height and weight as input and then calculates their BMI using the formula (weight / (height * height)). 

It then provides the user with their BMI value and a corresponding interpretation of their BMI, such as whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

BMI Score with meaning:
- Upto 18.5 - Underweight
- 18.5 to 24.9 - Healthy weight
- 25 to 29.9 - Overweight
- 30 to 34.4 - Obesity
- 35 to 39.9 - Extreme obesity
